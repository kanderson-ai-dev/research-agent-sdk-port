"""Prompt templates for the LLM-driven agent roles: planner, critic, writer.

Prompts live here as a first-class, reviewable artifact rather than inline in
the LLM client — a prompt change is a behavioral change to an agent role, so
it should be visible in diffs and measurable through the EDD harness
(``evaluation/run_eval.py``).

Design decisions baked into these prompts:

- **Structured outputs** (``Agent(output_type=...)``) carry the contract;
  prompts shape behavior, schemas enforce shape — no free-text parsing.
- **Bounded evidence**: each source is truncated before interpolation so
  context size, latency, and cost stay predictable.
- **Citations must be verbatim**: the writer is instructed to copy short
  quotes directly from the cited source's extracted text and to reference
  the provided ``[source_id]`` labels. The output guardrail then verifies
  every quote mechanically — fabricated citations are dropped, never kept.
- **No untrusted instructions**: scraped text is presented strictly as
  ``Evidence`` data inside the human turn; the sanitization guardrail has
  already stripped injection-style lines from it (OWASP LLM01).
